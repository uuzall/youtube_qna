[INST] * that, the visualization of that, can enhance the mental training and visualization in significant ways. So when we apply identities or names to these mental trainings and visualizations, and again, provide that they are brief and repeated and so on, we greatly enhance the amount of neural machinery in the brain and body that we are able to recruit when we go to perform those real world golf swings and golf putts, and here just replace golf swing and golf putt with anything that you're trying to learn, you're able to recruit a lot more neural machinery and greatly increase the probability of proper execution. So before we go any further, I want to share with you a couple of incredible aspects of mental visualization that really can be harnessed and applied toward mental training and visualization. Some of these were done by Roger Shepherd and his graduate students in post-docs, some were done by Steve Costlin and by others. What these experiments really show is that mental training and visualization is capturing many, many of the exact same features of real world behavior and perceptions. Not all of them, but many of them. So for instance, if I tell you to close your eyes and imagine a ceiling that has tiles that are black and white checkered tiles, you know, one black tile, one white tile, for instance, we know based on experiments where we measure eye movements behind closed eyelids, that people tend to move their eyes up when they are imagining things above them, such as a ceiling. Whereas if I tell you to imagine things down on the floor, like you're taking a hike and you're looking for rattlesnakes, actually just recently I experienced because it's spring here in California, rattlesnake along a hiking trail. It's really quite beautiful. Although I have to confess, I enjoyed keeping my distance. I don't like snakes very much. I don't dislike snakes, but I prefer not to interact with them unless I have to. If I have you imagine that rattlesnake, depending on your relationship or thoughts about rattlesnakes, a number of things will happen in your brain, of course, activation of the limbic system or not, for instance. But what I know is that regardless of how you feel about snakes, most of you will move your eyes down when imagining a snake. Okay, it might be subtle, it might be fast, but statistically that result shows up as opposed to when I imagine or I ask you to imagine something above you, tend to move your eyes up. In addition to that, if I tell you, for instance, to imagine an elephant and a mouse next to one another, you presumably have some real-world understanding about the relative sizes of elephants versus mice. Elephants generally are bigger than mice, thank goodness. Mice are smaller than elephants. If I ask you to tell me about the details of that mouse's face, so for instance, can you see its whiskers? The processing time required for you to do that is much
* serve, or when we actually try a math problem or we try and learn some specific knowledge and write it down and remember it. That is engaging particular neurons, right? They're firing, they're releasing chemicals, but it is also actively suppressing the activity of other neurons. And we are always completely unaware of the ways in which our brain is suppressing certain activity. Okay, so today we have to keep in mind that where there is strengthening of connections, there is also weakening of connections. And when it comes to mental training and visualization, and here's the really key point, with mental training and visualization, you are capturing both processes, both the potentiation, that is the building up and strengthening of connections, and the weakening of the connections that are inappropriate for the thing you're trying to learn. And there are different aspects of mental training and visualization protocols that really harness the potentiation versus the depression aspect. And today we will cover mental training and visualization protocols that capture both the potentiation and the depression aspect of neuroplasticity. And in that way serve as an augment, that is a compliment to the actual real world cognitive and physical training that you're doing. Because I'll just give this away right now. Turns out that mental training and visualization is not a replacement for real world cognitive or motor behavior. Again, mental training and visualization cannot replace real world execution of cognitive tasks or of motor tasks if you want to learn. However, mental training and visualization can and has been shown to be effective for greatly enhancing the speed at which you learn and the stability of that learning over time. Okay, so let's take a second and really think about what's happening in the brain and body when we do mental training or visualization. In fact, we can do a little experiment right now that is not unlike many of the classic experiments looking at what's happening in the brain and body during mental training and visualization in which I just ask you to close your eyes and imagine a yellow cube, okay? And next to that yellow cube is a red rose. And perhaps I also ask you to float or fly up above the cube and the rose and look at them from the top, top down. And then I tell you to fly back around and land behind those and look at them from the perspective of behind that yellow cube and that red rose. Okay. Now, what the data tell us is that most people will be able to do that. Most of you will be able to do that to some degree or another, regardless of your attention span, whether or not you have ADHD or not, most of you will be able to do that to some degree or another. We also know from neuroimaging studies in which people are placed into a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner that during the sort of visualization you just did or that I described that your visual cortex
* what the research says about mental visualization. Now, the classic work on mental visualization really hinges on a number of different researchers and their work, but in particular, Roger Shepard, who did this work at Stanford and Stephen Cosslin, who's now at Harvard. Of course, others in the field, but it's really the work of Shepard and Cosslin that lay the foundation for our understanding of what happens in the brain when we mentally visualize something. Shepard did these incredible experiments in which he had students mentally visualize simple objects like a square, like a triangle. And he measured how long it took them to do that. Now, of course, at the time when he did these experiments, there were no sophisticated brain imaging devices and machines like fMRI. However, everything I'm about to describe has been later confirmed using things like fMRI. What Shepard did and what he found is that if people were told to visualize very simple objects, they did it pretty quickly. However, if they were told to visualize more complex objects or importantly to rotate those objects in their mind's eye, well, then it took longer for them to perform those mental visualizations. Now, many of you might think, duh, if I have to just imagine a triangle or a cube, that's going to be very easy and very fast. Whereas if I have to rotate that triangle or a cube in my mind's eye, that's going to take more time. And indeed, that is somewhat of a duh, except, and this is so very important, except that what Shepard and his colleagues found is that how long it takes somebody to generate and rotate a given visual image scales directly with the complexity of that image. In fact, Kozlin did some experiments, I think illustrate this even better. And here's the experiment. I love this experiment. I think you'll love it too, because it illustrates something so fundamentally important about how our brains work, not just for sake of mental training and visualization, but just how our brains work at all. He showed people a picture of a map. So a map drawn on a piece of paper. This was a map of an island. It included things like a loading dock for some boats. It had a location for getting food on the island. It had some trees. It had some other small landmarks drawn out. And people looked at this and memorized it. Or in other experiments, they just had people imagine this island and the location of these different landmarks on the island. So it didn't really matter which, but then he had people imagine moving or walking from one location on the island to another. So they'd say, okay, you're at the loading dock, now move to the restaurant. Okay, you're at the restaurant, now move to the palm tree. You're on the North shore of the island, now go around the side of the island clockwise to arrive at the bay on the southwest corner, this sort of thing. What Kozlin
* However, and I just have to chuckle because I think these experiments are so clever. If I have you trace or draw with a pen on a piece of paper, an impossible figure or the face's vases by stable image. And then I ask you to imagine that by stable image or impossible figure and to switch back and forth, you were able to do it. So what that illustrates is that it's the combination of imagined and real world experiences, real motor movements, real perceptual experiences combined with motor movements, combined with what you imagine in your mind's eye that really gives you the most depth and flexibility over your mental visualization. And in doing so, we can really stamp down a third principle of mental training and visualization, which is that your mental training and visualization will be far more effective if you are performing the exact same or very similar mental and physical tasks in the real world. Okay, so first principle is mental training and visualization needs to be simple and brief and repeated. Second is that mental training and visualization is not a replacement for real world motor training or cognitive training. It's an augment. It's an addition that can really help. And the third principle of mental training and visualization is that you need to combine mental training and visualization with real world behaviors and experiences that are very, very similar. Now as a brief, but I think really relevant aside, one of the things that also makes mental training and visualization more effective is when we assign cognitive labels to what's going on when we visualize. So what I mean is that people are much better at manipulating faces and faces in their mind's eye. Of course, only once they've drawn them out physically with their hand, as I mentioned before, then they are manipulating abstract objects like impossible figures in part because by labeling them faces and vases, people are able to capture a lot of other neural machinery that's related to faces and vases. In fact, we have entire brain areas on both sides of the brain devoted to the processing of faces, they're called fusiform face area. We have other areas in our brain that are involved in processing of 3D objects, but faces are of particular value. There's a value to understanding what a face is as opposed to a non-face. And there's a value to understanding what a particular face is. In fact, the simplest way to put this is that the human brain is in many ways a face recognition and expression of faces recognition machine. It of course does other things, but it is exceptionally good at that. Unless you're in a profession in which the relationships between 3D objects and your ability to manipulate them is exceedingly important, you're not going to have a lot of neural real estate specifically devoted to that. Some people will be better at it, some people will be worse. But when it comes to faces, unless you have a condition like

Based on the video transcript above answer the following question. 
Question: What are the benefits of visualization? [/INST]
Answer: According to the video transcript, visualization can enhance mental training and visualization in significant ways. Some of the benefits of visualization include:

1. Capturing many of the exact same features of real-world behavior and perceptions.
2. Moving the eyes up when imagining things above and down when imagining things below.
3. Serving as an augmentation to real-world cognitive and physical training.
4. Enhancing the speed at which learning occurs and the stability of that learning over time.
5. Allowing people to capture both the potentiation and weakening of connections in the brain.
6. Being effective for greatly enhancing the learning process.
7. Combining mental training and visualization with real-world behaviors and experiences that are very similar can make mental training and visualization more effective.
8. Assigning cognitive labels to what's going on when visualizing can make it more effective.

Overall, visualization can have a significant impact on the brain and body, and can be a valuable tool for mental training and visualization.</s>

[INST] * found was absolutely incredible. What he found was that the amount of time that it takes people to move from one location on the map to another, scaled linearly, directly with the actual physical location between those objects on the map. So for those of you that can understand or into the importance of what Shepard and Coslin showed, great. I'm guessing, however, that for most people out there, you're still grasping it like, okay, interesting, you know, how things happen in the real world dictates how they happen in our mind's eye. But I want to make sure that I really nail home the importance of this for everybody. The importance of this is that when we look at something in the real world, so if I look at the pen in front of me, I'm holding up my pen for those of you that are listening, just holding up my pen in front of me, and I move it to the right and back and forth. What's happening is I'm activating or I'm triggering the electrical activity of neurons, which we can think of kind of as pixels in my eye. Okay, so it's leftward to rightward motion for me and back and forth. And those are getting activated and they're sending signals up to my visual cortex. And that information is processed at a given speed. What the visualization experiments that Shepard and Kozlin and others did show is that the processing speed of imagined experiences is exactly the same as the processing speed of real experiences. And the spatial relationship between imagined and real experiences is exactly the same as well. Put simply, when we imagine something in our mind's eye or mind's ear, we are imagining the real thing happening. And when I say the real thing, it's not the obvious real thing. Of course, if you're imagining something, that's the thing you're imagining. What I mean is that your brain at the level of neurons is behaving exactly the same way. And this needn't have been the case, okay? There could have been a result, for instance, that if people were asked to visualize a cube and rotate it from, you know, flip it from top to bottom, okay? So put the top that's upward on a table, now down on the table and so forth, or to migrate around the island, you know, counterclockwise going from, you know, the Northern coast all the way down to the Southern coast clockwise and then back up to the Northern coast that they could have just done it really quickly like all in one second, but that's not what happens. They always match the speed at which they do things in their mind's eye to the same speed that they do them in the real world. So in telling you this, what I'm saying is that mental visualization at the neural level is identical to real world events. So when you've heard that when we imagine something, it's identical in terms of our brain's experience of it and
* and associated areas, quote unquote, light up. They become very active in similar but not identical ways to how they would light up and be activated were you to actually look at a yellow cube and a red rose on a screen and perhaps fly above them, virtually of course, and land behind them, virtually of course. Or if you were to actually look at a yellow cube and red rose in the real world, right in front of you on a table, then get up on your tippy toes and look down at them from the top and then walk around the table and look at them from the other side. So there is some degree of what we call perceptual equivalence between real world experiences, digital experiences and imagined, meaning with our eyes closed, just in our mind's eye experiences. And this is true, not just of vision and what we call the visual domain, but also the auditory domain. Okay, so for instance, I could play for you a short motif of a song. Let's just pick something that I think most people know. Goodness, I'm a terrible musician and even worse singer, but let's just take the opening to ACDC's Back in Black, right? I think I can do that when it's like, okay, got it. That's the actual sound, although admittedly a dreadful version of the great ACDC song Back in Black. But now I ask you to close your eyes or you could keep them open and just imagine that. Okay. Or for instance, I place you in a quiet room. So you close your eyes and ask you to imagine the opening to ACDC's Black in Black, but ask you to pause it halfway through. What you would find again is that most people, somewhere between 90 and 95% of people would be able to do all the sorts of things I described, right? Cube and rose, ACD back in black. Even a somatosensory task. I imagine you to imagine what it's like to touch felt or to touch chinchilla hair or something like that, a chinchilla's hair, ideally a live chinchilla sitting still. Those little critters move really, really fast, but they have very, very soft hair, high hair density, so soft. Okay, most people can do that. About 5% to 15% of people are less able to do that. And there's a small percentage of people in that five to 15% that simply cannot do it at all. That just cannot visualize well. And we'll talk later about these people. They have what's called aphantasia, an inability to mentally visualize. But most people are actually pretty good at visualizing things when they are told what to visualize. And, and this is a really key point. And if what they are told to visualize is very simple and the whole visualization is quite brief, lasting on the order of about 15 seconds to generate the visualization in the auditory or in the visual aspect of one's mind's eye or ear, if you will. And
* you realize that you're looking at the side angle or the profile of two faces looking at one another. And when you see those two faces looking at one another, you can't see the vases at the same time. But then if you decide to see the vases again, you can see the vases again, but the faces disappear. So it's bistable, meaning that you can't see the faces and vases at the same time. And impossible figures and bistable images are capturing the fact that your visual cortex and some of the associated areas that compute visual scenes in your world are essentially trying to recreate whatever it is that's out in front of them. And that's effectively what your visual system does. It's very good at recreating visual images in your brain, in your mind's eye. Because if you think about it, even with your eyes open, your brain is just creating an abstract representation of what it thinks is out there. But that when it comes to assigning an identity to something like, oh, that's a face or, oh, that's a vase, that is constrained by different neural circuits, by different areas of the brain. And somehow those circuits can't be co-active. We cannot see the faces and the vases at exactly the same time. We can switch back and forth really quickly, just as we can switch back and forth really quickly when we're looking at the impossible figure and think, okay, that's the front of it. That's the back. No, wait, that's the back. That's the front. And it's going back and forth, but we can't see them both at the same time. No one can see them both at the same time. Okay. We know this from brain imaging studies. Now, impossible figures and bistable images can be seen, right? You could look them up right now on your phone or computer, or I could show you pictures of them on paper right in front of you. And you can do these sorts of perceptual experiments of telling people, look at the face, look at the vase, look at the front of the cube, and I'll make it at the back of the cube. And they can do this somewhat deliberately. However, and this is, I think, so very interesting to understanding how mental training and visualization does and does not support real-world learning. If you try to imagine a bistable image, you can't do it. In fact, no one can do it until they do something else. So for those of you that are saying, wait, I can do it. I can do faces, vases in my mind's eye. I promise you that the neuroimaging disputes your belief, okay? And supports the idea that we can see real world by stable images. We can see real world impossible figures. But when we try and imagine those in our mind's eye, we simply can't do it. We can't do the perceptual shift in our mind's eye. We can't switch back and forth between faces and vases.
* actually do this, but looking at yourself from a third person perspective in your mind's eye and seeing yourself perform that cognitive challenge, whatever that challenge may happen to be. Okay. Now we have to address eyes open versus eyes closed. And this is where the literature gets pretty interesting. I always thought for some reason, I don't know why, but I presumed that mental training and visualization should always be done eyes closed. But it turns out that's not how a lot of studies of mental training and visualization have been done. And in fact, many of them have arrived at really impressive protocols, which are essentially the protocols that I've distilled out and I'm listing out during today's episode, having people either watch videos of themselves performing a given skill and imagining themselves in that role. And again, it's them. So again, during the mental training visualization, they're watching a movie of themselves. So they're somewhat in the third person perspective. I guess we could technically say they are in the third person perspective, but they're watching themself. So in doing that, we know based on neuroimaging studies that when we watch videos of ourselves doing things, we experienced that more from a first person perspective than if we watch videos of other people doing things. Use your imagination here, folks. So if you're somebody, for instance, who's trying to get better at a particular skill, this could be not just sport, but also public speaking, watching videos of yourself doing that can be very effective. But of course we have to come back to the first principle of effective mental training and visualization, which is that whatever it is that we're trying to build up or consolidate as a skill needs to be brief and repeated. So what we're really talking about here is watching a video of ourselves on loop or listening to a audio or audio video recording of ourselves on loop for whatever aspect that we're trying to build up or improve upon. Now, for people that, for instance, are trying to get better at dealing with public speaking and there isn't a particular skill or utterance of particular sentences or words that they're trying to accomplish, but rather they're trying to learn to be more relaxed or to articulate better in the public speaking scenario. There would be one of the few instances in which I'd suggest more general theme and not exact recapitulation of some specific words that you're going to say. Perhaps it could be a sequence of you walking out onto stage toward the podium or out from the podium and facing the audience and looking in multiple directions up and down to see people in every corner of the room and just repeating that on loop in your mind's eye or watching yourself do that on video and making yourself calm in your internal state as you're doing that. This is more of mental autonomic training because what you're really trying to do is control your autonomic nervous system, the nervous

Based on the video transcript above answer the following question. 
Question: What does he mean when he said "Moving the eyes up when imagining things above and down when imagining things below." [/INST]
Answer: The speaker is referring to a phenomenon known as "spatial mapping," which is the tendency for people to associate specific locations in their mind's eye with specific locations in the real world. When imagining something, people tend to visualize it in the same spatial location that they would see it in real life. For example, if someone is imagining a cube, they might visualize it in the same location on the table that they would see it in real life.

The speaker is saying that when people imagine something, their brain behaves as if they are actually seeing it in front of them, and they associate the mental image with a specific location in their mind's eye. This is why people tend to move their eyes up or down when imagining something above or below their current location.

It's important to note that this is not a conscious process, but rather an automatic one that occurs without people realizing it. The speaker is highlighting this phenomenon to demonstrate the similarity between mental visualization and real-world experiences.</s>

[INST] * out that is not true. It is simply not true. However, there is somewhat of an equivalence between a real experience and an imagined experience. And we'll talk about the difference between those and how that can be leveraged in order to get the most out of mental training and visualization. Then I will cover exactly which types of mental training and visualization work best across all domains, meaning for music learning, mathematics, solving puzzles, motor learning, sports performance, et cetera, et cetera, to really allow you a template in which you can plug in or designate what you're going to do each day for a brief period of time in order to accelerate your learning in whatever you choose. And then I'm going to go into a bit of what happens in the brains of different types of people. These different types of people that I'm referring to are people who have more or less of a natural ability to imagine things and visualize them. Because it turns out that we vary tremendously from one individual to the next in terms of our ability to mentally visualize and imagine things and our ability to get better at that over time. And the good news is anyone can get better at mental training and visualization in ways that can serve them well. I'll also briefly touch on the fact that certain people, in particular people on the autism spectrum, as well as people with synesthesia, which is the combining of different perceptual experiences. So you may be one of these people, or you may have heard of people that, for instance, when they think of a number, they also just naturally, spontaneously think of a color and vice versa. We'll talk about how that relates to mental imagery and visualization and the creative process and problem solving in general. And then finally, what I'll do is I'll recap mental training and visualization from the standpoint of how best to apply mental training and visualization according to specific challenges. Things like challenges with public speaking or challenges with sports performance or challenges with test taking performance, challenges with essentially anything that will allow you to build specific mental training and visualization practices that are brief, that are supported by neuroscience studies and that are highly effective. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need, meaning sodium, magnesium, and potassium, but nothing that you don't, meaning no sugar. And it has the sodium, magnesium, and potassium in the ideal ratios for hydrating and providing electrolytes to the cells and tissues of your body.

But of course we have to come back to the first principle of effective mental training and visualization, which is that whatever it is that we're trying to build up or consolidate as a skill needs to be brief and repeated. So what we're really talking about here is watching a video of ourselves on loop or listening to a audio or audio video recording of ourselves on loop for whatever aspect that we're trying to build up or improve upon. Now, for people that, for instance, are trying to get better at dealing with public speaking and there isn't a particular skill or utterance of particular sentences or words that they're trying to accomplish, but rather they're trying to learn to be more relaxed or to articulate better in the public speaking scenario. There would be one of the few instances in which I'd suggest more general theme and not exact recapitulation of some specific words that you're going to say. Perhaps it could be a sequence of you walking out onto stage toward the podium or out from the podium and facing the audience and looking in multiple directions up and down to see people in every corner of the room and just repeating that on loop in your mind's eye or watching yourself do that on video and making yourself calm in your internal state as you're doing that. This is more of mental autonomic training because what you're really trying to do is control your autonomic nervous system, the nervous

Based on the video transcript above answer the following question. 
Question: How do I train myself to visualize? [/INST]
Answer: Training yourself to visualize involves developing a consistent mental imagery practice, which can be achieved through various techniques. Here are some tips to help you get started:

1. Set aside a quiet and comfortable space: Find a place where you can relax and focus your attention without any distractions.
2. Close your eyes: Shutting your eyes can help you concentrate better and block out external stimuli.
3. Use all your senses: Try to engage your senses in the visualization process. For example, if you're visualizing a beach, imagine the sound of the waves, the feel of the sand beneath your feet, and the smell of the ocean.
4. Be specific: The more details you include in your visualization, the more vivid it will be. For instance, if you're visualizing a specific object, try to imagine its shape, color, and texture.
5. Practice regularly: Consistency is key when it comes to developing a strong visualization practice. Set aside a specific time each day to practice visualization.
6. Start small: Begin with simple visualizations and gradually increase the complexity as you become more comfortable with the practice.
7. Use visualization for specific goals: Identify a specific goal you want to achieve through visualization, such as improving your golf swing or memorizing a speech. This will help you stay focused and motivated.
8. Learn to control your breathing: Deep breathing can help you relax and enter a meditative state, which is essential for effective visualization. Practice deep breathing exercises regularly to improve your breath control.
9. Use visualization in combination with physical practice: Visualization can be a powerful tool to enhance your physical practice. For example, if you're practicing a musical instrument, visualize yourself playing it perfectly before you start playing.
10. Be patient: Developing a strong visualization practice takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results.

Remember, visualization is a skill that can be developed with consistent practice. Start with small steps and gradually build up to more complex visualizations. With time and effort, you can train yourself to visualize with greater accuracy and clarity.</s>

**TEMPERATURE 0.1** 
To train yourself to visualize, the speaker suggests the following:

1. Practice visualization regularly: Set aside a few minutes each day to practice visualization. Start with simple tasks or scenarios and gradually increase the complexity.
2. Use vivid mental imagery: Try to create a vivid mental image of the scenario or task you want to visualize. Use all of your senses to bring the image to life, including sights, sounds, smells, and feelings.
3. Focus on the details: Pay attention to the details of the scenario or task you are visualizing. Try to mentally recreate the scene or situation as accurately as possible.
4. Use visualization to overcome challenges: Visualization can be a powerful tool for overcoming challenges and improving performance. Identify specific areas where you want to improve, and use visualization to mentally rehearse and practice those skills.
5. Combine visualization with real-world practice: While visualization can be a powerful tool on its own, it's essential to combine it with real-world practice to achieve the best results. Use visualization to mentally rehearse and practice skills, and then apply those skills in real-world situations.

By following these tips, you can train yourself to visualize and improve your performance in various domains. Remember to practice regularly, use vivid mental imagery, focus on the details, use visualization to overcome challenges, and combine visualization with real-world practice.</s>

[INST] * out that is not true. It is simply not true. However, there is somewhat of an equivalence between a real experience and an imagined experience. And we'll talk about the difference between those and how that can be leveraged in order to get the most out of mental training and visualization. Then I will cover exactly which types of mental training and visualization work best across all domains, meaning for music learning, mathematics, solving puzzles, motor learning, sports performance, et cetera, et cetera, to really allow you a template in which you can plug in or designate what you're going to do each day for a brief period of time in order to accelerate your learning in whatever you choose. And then I'm going to go into a bit of what happens in the brains of different types of people. These different types of people that I'm referring to are people who have more or less of a natural ability to imagine things and visualize them. Because it turns out that we vary tremendously from one individual to the next in terms of our ability to mentally visualize and imagine things and our ability to get better at that over time. And the good news is anyone can get better at mental training and visualization in ways that can serve them well. I'll also briefly touch on the fact that certain people, in particular people on the autism spectrum, as well as people with synesthesia, which is the combining of different perceptual experiences. So you may be one of these people, or you may have heard of people that, for instance, when they think of a number, they also just naturally, spontaneously think of a color and vice versa. We'll talk about how that relates to mental imagery and visualization and the creative process and problem solving in general. And then finally, what I'll do is I'll recap mental training and visualization from the standpoint of how best to apply mental training and visualization according to specific challenges. Things like challenges with public speaking or challenges with sports performance or challenges with test taking performance, challenges with essentially anything that will allow you to build specific mental training and visualization practices that are brief, that are supported by neuroscience studies and that are highly effective. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need, meaning sodium, magnesium, and potassium, but nothing that you don't, meaning no sugar. And it has the sodium, magnesium, and potassium in the ideal ratios for hydrating and providing electrolytes to the cells and tissues of your body. So I use Element in my water when I wake up, I like to
* that, the visualization of that, can enhance the mental training and visualization in significant ways. So when we apply identities or names to these mental trainings and visualizations, and again, provide that they are brief and repeated and so on, we greatly enhance the amount of neural machinery in the brain and body that we are able to recruit when we go to perform those real world golf swings and golf putts, and here just replace golf swing and golf putt with anything that you're trying to learn, you're able to recruit a lot more neural machinery and greatly increase the probability of proper execution. So before we go any further, I want to share with you a couple of incredible aspects of mental visualization that really can be harnessed and applied toward mental training and visualization. Some of these were done by Roger Shepherd and his graduate students in post-docs, some were done by Steve Costlin and by others. What these experiments really show is that mental training and visualization is capturing many, many of the exact same features of real world behavior and perceptions. Not all of them, but many of them. So for instance, if I tell you to close your eyes and imagine a ceiling that has tiles that are black and white checkered tiles, you know, one black tile, one white tile, for instance, we know based on experiments where we measure eye movements behind closed eyelids, that people tend to move their eyes up when they are imagining things above them, such as a ceiling. Whereas if I tell you to imagine things down on the floor, like you're taking a hike and you're looking for rattlesnakes, actually just recently I experienced because it's spring here in California, rattlesnake along a hiking trail. It's really quite beautiful. Although I have to confess, I enjoyed keeping my distance. I don't like snakes very much. I don't dislike snakes, but I prefer not to interact with them unless I have to. If I have you imagine that rattlesnake, depending on your relationship or thoughts about rattlesnakes, a number of things will happen in your brain, of course, activation of the limbic system or not, for instance. But what I know is that regardless of how you feel about snakes, most of you will move your eyes down when imagining a snake. Okay, it might be subtle, it might be fast, but statistically that result shows up as opposed to when I imagine or I ask you to imagine something above you, tend to move your eyes up. In addition to that, if I tell you, for instance, to imagine an elephant and a mouse next to one another, you presumably have some real-world understanding about the relative sizes of elephants versus mice. Elephants generally are bigger than mice, thank goodness. Mice are smaller than elephants. If I ask you to tell me about the details of that mouse's face, so for instance, can you see its whiskers? The processing time required for you to do that is much
* serve, or when we actually try a math problem or we try and learn some specific knowledge and write it down and remember it. That is engaging particular neurons, right? They're firing, they're releasing chemicals, but it is also actively suppressing the activity of other neurons. And we are always completely unaware of the ways in which our brain is suppressing certain activity. Okay, so today we have to keep in mind that where there is strengthening of connections, there is also weakening of connections. And when it comes to mental training and visualization, and here's the really key point, with mental training and visualization, you are capturing both processes, both the potentiation, that is the building up and strengthening of connections, and the weakening of the connections that are inappropriate for the thing you're trying to learn. And there are different aspects of mental training and visualization protocols that really harness the potentiation versus the depression aspect. And today we will cover mental training and visualization protocols that capture both the potentiation and the depression aspect of neuroplasticity. And in that way serve as an augment, that is a compliment to the actual real world cognitive and physical training that you're doing. Because I'll just give this away right now. Turns out that mental training and visualization is not a replacement for real world cognitive or motor behavior. Again, mental training and visualization cannot replace real world execution of cognitive tasks or of motor tasks if you want to learn. However, mental training and visualization can and has been shown to be effective for greatly enhancing the speed at which you learn and the stability of that learning over time. Okay, so let's take a second and really think about what's happening in the brain and body when we do mental training or visualization. In fact, we can do a little experiment right now that is not unlike many of the classic experiments looking at what's happening in the brain and body during mental training and visualization in which I just ask you to close your eyes and imagine a yellow cube, okay? And next to that yellow cube is a red rose. And perhaps I also ask you to float or fly up above the cube and the rose and look at them from the top, top down. And then I tell you to fly back around and land behind those and look at them from the perspective of behind that yellow cube and that red rose. Okay. Now, what the data tell us is that most people will be able to do that. Most of you will be able to do that to some degree or another, regardless of your attention span, whether or not you have ADHD or not, most of you will be able to do that to some degree or another. We also know from neuroimaging studies in which people are placed into a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner that during the sort of visualization you just did or that I described that your visual cortex
* actually do this, but looking at yourself from a third person perspective in your mind's eye and seeing yourself perform that cognitive challenge, whatever that challenge may happen to be. Okay. Now we have to address eyes open versus eyes closed. And this is where the literature gets pretty interesting. I always thought for some reason, I don't know why, but I presumed that mental training and visualization should always be done eyes closed. But it turns out that's not how a lot of studies of mental training and visualization have been done. And in fact, many of them have arrived at really impressive protocols, which are essentially the protocols that I've distilled out and I'm listing out during today's episode, having people either watch videos of themselves performing a given skill and imagining themselves in that role. And again, it's them. So again, during the mental training visualization, they're watching a movie of themselves. So they're somewhat in the third person perspective. I guess we could technically say they are in the third person perspective, but they're watching themself. So in doing that, we know based on neuroimaging studies that when we watch videos of ourselves doing things, we experienced that more from a first person perspective than if we watch videos of other people doing things. Use your imagination here, folks. So if you're somebody, for instance, who's trying to get better at a particular skill, this could be not just sport, but also public speaking, watching videos of yourself doing that can be very effective. But of course we have to come back to the first principle of effective mental training and visualization, which is that whatever it is that we're trying to build up or consolidate as a skill needs to be brief and repeated. So what we're really talking about here is watching a video of ourselves on loop or listening to a audio or audio video recording of ourselves on loop for whatever aspect that we're trying to build up or improve upon. Now, for people that, for instance, are trying to get better at dealing with public speaking and there isn't a particular skill or utterance of particular sentences or words that they're trying to accomplish, but rather they're trying to learn to be more relaxed or to articulate better in the public speaking scenario.

Based on the video transcript above answer the following question. 
Question: How do I train myself to visualize?
Answer:[/INST]  To train yourself to visualize, follow these steps:

1. Practice brief and repeated mental imagery exercises: Identify specific skills or tasks you want to improve, and visualize yourself performing them in detail. Repeat this process multiple times a day.
2. Use Element to enhance neural machinery: Drink Element, an electrolyte drink with the ideal ratios of sodium, magnesium, and potassium, to hydrate and provide electrolytes to your body. This can help recruit more neural machinery when performing real-world tasks.
3. Observe the relationship between eye movements and visualization: When imagining things above or below you, your eyes will move accordingly. Note this phenomenon and use it to your advantage in your visualization practices.
4. Experiment with eyes open or closed: While some studies suggest eyes closed visualization, others have arrived at impressive protocols using eyes open methods, such as watching videos of yourself performing a given skill.
5. Focus on building up and consolidating skills: Whatever skill or task you're trying to improve, make sure to practice it in brief and repeated sessions. This will help strengthen the connections in your brain and improve your ability to visualize.
6. Practice mental autonomic training: For tasks like public speaking, visualize yourself relaxed and articulating well in the scenario, repeating the process in your mind's eye or on video to control your autonomic nervous system.

By incorporating these strategies into your daily routine, you can improve your ability to visualize and enhance your mental training and visualization practices.</s>

[INST] * This dot is the city of Adelaide, Australia's fifth largest city home to more than 1.3 million people. And immediately adjacent to this oasis of urban life is the pastoral unincorporated area, a territory that's roughly the size of France, but is only home to a whopping 3,750 people, making the population density something like 178 square kilometers of land for every one person. That is roughly one Aruba's worth of land for every single resident inside of the pastoral unincorporated area. Then there's also Anna Creek right over here. This is a huge territory that's slightly larger than Israel, and yet it isn't a country or even a governmental entity at all. No, Anna Creek is actually just a privately owned cattle ranch. The largest cattle ranch found anywhere in the world by far that is only staffed by eight full-time employees according to Wikipedia. So, this entire area that's the size of Israel is usually only home to less than a dozen people and around 10,000 cows. Australia is really, really, really empty. And to hammer the point home even further, consider the towns of Esperance on the South Coast and Kununurra near to the North Coast. Both of these towns are within the same state of Western Australia, and it takes at least 35 hours of time to drive from one to the other across a distance of more than 3200 kilometers. And along that entire distance in time, you'll maybe only drive through a population of less than 70,000 people the entire way. For comparison, this drive would be about the same time and distance as driving from Madrid to Istanbul across nearly the whole of Europe, where there would be a lot more than 70,000 people. So what is it about Australia that makes it such an overall and you were thinking right now is the desert. Duh. Everybody knows that Australia is covered in a big old desert with tons of super dangerous animals and insects. Who would ever want to actually live in most of the country? And while there is some truth to this line of thinking, I am here to argue with you that that's only a small part of the overall population puzzle in Australia. And the full explanation for why there are so few people on this continent is overall a pretty complicated one. Most of the problem stems from the fact that Australia is pretty uniquely cursed when it comes to both the geologic and location perspective. Located relatively close by to Antarctica, the frozen continent, the western side of Australia is continuously battered by cold ocean currents coming up from the southern ocean, which means that there simply isn't enough heat to generate large-scale evaporation that's necessary to form rain clouds over much of the west. Meanwhile in the east, the Great Dividing Range is Australia's largest and longest chain of mountains, and the fifth longest anywhere in the world. These mountains run down the entire eastern side of the continent from north to south, and their height denies
* Of all the world's continents, Australia may be the smallest, but it's also the only one to be entirely controlled by just a single country. Almost everybody knows, though, that while Australia is a huge place in terms of land, it's also a pretty small place in terms of population. But few people really understand the absolute scale of how sparsely populated the Australian continent actually is. To help put the numbers into some perspective, Australia is of a comparable size to the lower 48 US states. These 48 US states have a population of more than 300 million people, while Australia only has a population of little more than 26 million. This means that there are two American states that have more people than the entirety of the Australian continent. California with more than 39 million, and Texas with more than 28 million. From our European perspective, the population of only England, without factoring in any of the rest of the UK UK is more than double the entire population of Australia. Despite being an entire continent, there are actually seven significantly smaller islands across the world that have higher populations than Australia. Great Britain, of course, along with Honshu, Luzon, Mindanao, Java, Sumatra, and Madagascar. Java alone has nearly 6 times Australia's tiny population, despite being an island that is 60 times smaller than Australia, the continent. But it still gets even crazier because there's also a bunch of cities across the world that, right now, have more people than the entire continent as well. The Tokyo, Jakarta, and Delhi metropolitan areas all have greater populations than the entirety of Australia, while the Shanghai and Seoul metro areas have roughly similar populations. Sao Paulo, Mexico City, New York City, Cairo, Lagos, Mumbai, and Moscow all have largely comparable metropolitan populations to Australia as well. At all things considered, Australia really only has five actual major cities across their continent. Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide, which collectively account for the residences of nearly two out of every three Australians. Australia is therefore among the most heavily urbanized nations in the world, with the overwhelming majority of the population, around 90%, concentrated into relatively small urban areas that only account for 0.22% of Australia's total land area, with half of the overall population living within just these red areas, and the other half almost entirely living in these blue areas. Overall, around 85% of all Australians live within just 50 kilometers of the coastline, meaning that there's hardly anyone deeper into the continent's vast interior. This unique population distribution creates a lot of fascinatingly bizarre situations across the continent. For example, this is the Shire of East Pilbara in Western Australia. It is roughly the same size as Japan, but there's only a bit more than 10,000 people who live here, and half of them just live right here in the town of Newman. It's basically just a small town, but with the space of Japan. Then, perhaps even more strangely, there's the pastoral unincorporated area down here in South Australia.
* put it in a context, Australia has more arable land than Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos all have combined. Despite all of these countries having a combined population of 542 million people, and Australia only having 26 million people. To put it into another perspective, Australia has by far the highest ratio in the entire world of arable land to population at around 1.9 arable hectares of land for every one citizen of the country. For the sake of comparison, the ratio in the United States is only about 0.47 arable hectares of land per one citizen. This means that if Australia ever reached the same ratio of arable land to people as the United States, the continent would be home to well over 90 million people. Still substantially less than the population of America, but also substantially more people than Australia has today. In theory, Australia does have enough space and resources to support a lot more people than the 26 million who live there today. The big reason why it doesn't is because for pretty much the entire history of Australia, right up until the present day, it's just been a really tough place for anyone to actually get to. You see, for millions of years now, Australia has been effectively a lost continent, isolated from all the Earth's other major land masses drifting alone out in the sea. This has resulted in millions of years of completely separate evolution for the animals of the continent, which is why Australia is unique among Earth's continents for the fact that marsupials, and not placental mammals, dominate the indigenous mammal wildlife species. Modern humans first reached the continent sometime around 50,000 years ago, when the area's geography looked radically different than it does today. With sea levels significantly lower back then, humans were able to simply walk down the Sunda Peninsula, hop across just a few islands, and then make it into present-day New Guinea, which back then was connected to Australia via a land bridge as the prehistoric continent of Sahul. And after these initial humans made it to the continent, they remained almost entirely undisturbed for tens of thousands of years by any other groups of humans from anywhere in the outside world. As sea levels began to rise following the end of the last ice age, Sahul was flooded and the land bridge between New Guinea and Australia fell beneath the waves around 10,000 years ago, making Australia even more remote than it had been previously, and even less likely to ever be visited by outsiders. For the next 9600 years before the eventual arrival of the Europeans in the 17th century, the Australian continent may have only been significantly visited and impacted by outside humans a total of just two times. Dingoes, an invasive species of dog likely originating from New Guinea, were introduced to Australia sometime around 8300 years ago, potentially by an unknown group of human visitors coming from the island. About 11% of the modern Aboriginal Australian DNA also derives from
* year, which is more than 22 times the flow of water that Australia's greatest river system has got. Nonetheless, it's the best that the continent has got, and the basin provides the drinking water for around 3 million Australians today, while the area around it has developed into the agricultural heartland of the modern Australian nation, providing nearly the entirety of the food that the 26 million people of Australia consume, along with enough to export to millions more across Asia. But as climate change continues to worsen the effects of drought on the continent, the waters that feed this agricultural heartland through the Murray-Darling Basin are getting harder and harder to come by with every passing decade. Nine of the ten hottest recorded years in the continent's history have taken place just since 2005. These higher temperatures are rapidly increasing the rates of evaporation throughout the waters of the basin, and with already limited rainfall throughout the majority of it, it's making the water here increasingly scarce, with some sections of the basin at times remaining completely dry for months on end. And it's not just the scarcity of fresh water on the continent that makes sustaining a very large population difficult. It's also the scarcity of good land for farming and agriculture, owing once again, largely, to geography, geology, and location. In northern Australia, there hasn't been any new mountain building since the Pre-Cambrian era that ended one and a half billion years ago. And even further, there hasn't been any glacial activity here since the Carboniferous ended nearly 300 million years ago. Thus, this entire region that covers nearly half of the continent has suffered its soils being beneath continuous weathering and erosion for well over 250 million years. Compared to less than 10,000 years for most of the soils on other continents like North America, Europe, or Asia. Therefore, the soil nearly everywhere in northern Australia just sucks for agriculture. The only exception to that rule is the area of the river basin that drains here into Lake Erie. But this is an overall small amount of the north, and the rainfall required for irrigation here is still very low. But the thing is, none of these geographic or climatic explanations really give the full picture. Because, despite everything that I just spent the last 10 minutes explaining to you, it turns out that Australia actually has a ton of fresh water resources. Well, at least when compared to countries and not to continents. In fact, Australia has an estimated 492 cubic kilometers worth of renewable freshwater resources, which is more than a lot of countries with significantly higher populations. That's twice as much as Pakistan, for example, a country which has more than eight times as many people. So it's not just a sheer lack of freshwater, and it's not just a sheer lack of arable land either. While, yeah, only about 6% of Australia's land is actually arable and suitable for agriculture, Australia is huge. So that 6% is still a ton of usable farmland. To

Based on the video transcript above answer the following question. 
Question: Why is Australia so empty?
Answer:[/INST]  Based on the video transcript, Australia is empty for several reasons:

1. Geographical location: Australia is located relatively close to Antarctica, the frozen continent, and is continuously battered by cold ocean currents coming up from the southern ocean, which makes it difficult for the continent to generate large-scale evaporation and form rain clouds over much of the west.
2. Population density: Australia is a vast country, but it has a relatively small population of around 26 million people, which is less than a dozen people per square kilometer. This is compared to other countries like the United States, which has a population of over 330 million people and a land area similar to Australia's.
3. Isolation: For millions of years, Australia was isolated from other land masses, which resulted in unique evolution for the animals of the continent. This isolation made it difficult for humans to reach the continent, and it remained undisturbed for tens of thousands of years by any other groups of humans from anywhere in the outside world.
4. Climate change: Australia is experiencing drought due to climate change, which is affecting the water resources of the continent, particularly in the agricultural heartland.
5. Geography and geology: Northern Australia has suffered soil erosion for over 250 million years due to continuous weathering, making it difficult for the region to support good land for farming and agriculture.

Overall, Australia's unique geographical location, isolation, and climate change are some of the reasons why it is relatively empty compared to other countries.</s>
